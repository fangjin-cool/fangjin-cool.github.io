About Me
======
Welcome! my name is Jin Fang. I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology with a bachelor's degree and obtained my master's degree from Peking University, majoring in Information Engineering. Since 2016, I have been engaged in research and development in the field of autonomous driving, with a particular interest in sensor simulation and 3D perception within this domain. I have participated in and led a series of related projects. I have published over 20 academic papers in top conferences and journals, including CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, TIP, and AAAI. You can find all my publications in Google Scholar. Additionally, I serve as a long-term reviewer for these prestigious academic conferences and journals. Currently, I hold a position in an academic institution, where I am interested in emotional intelligence, multimodal large models, end-to-end autonomous driving, world models, embodied intelligence, and more. I welcome discussions, exchanges, and collaboration!
